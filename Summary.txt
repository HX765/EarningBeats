Project description:

EarningBeats is a smart and powerful financial platform designed for investors with all levels of investment experience. Whether you are a beginner or an advantaged investor, all you need to do is inputting a stock ticker or the name of the public company you desire to dive into, a direct earning data visualization will then show up with a comparison between the company's actual EPS(earning per share) and expected EPS/consensus estimate for the latest four quarters.
